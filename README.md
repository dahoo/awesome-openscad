[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

## Goal
Attempting to bring more awesomeness & harmony to the OpenSCAD community. 


[![Project Status: WIP ‚Äì Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

I am marking this project as WIP planning for a better awesome-list.   An even awesomer openSCAD object/tool library 'embeddable awesome browser' & object discovery & repo package manager.  

Backend: RUST cargo + git, looking at spacedrive to host.  

The WIP is to create a unified repo to download openSCAD package objects (similar to a npmjs.org pip, but using RUST cargo)

If you have an openscad project and would like to be part of this list please add your project and stay tuned.
